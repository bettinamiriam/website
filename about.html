                                <p>Because the right to sex equality is not enshrined in the United States Constitution, women and girls do not enjoy full Constitutional protection from discrimination on account of sex.  The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) will provide fundamental legal protection and will promote greater public understanding of discrimination against women and the right to sex equality.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Why do we need the ERA?</h2>
                                <p>While many sex discriminatory laws have been repealed over the past century, and a number of laws have been passed to protect women and girls from sex discrimination, sex inequality continues to pervade the lives of women and girls.  In other countries around the world, Constitutions guarantee sex equality and prohibit sex discrimination.  We need the ERA to help end economic inequality, violence against women, and many other pervasive forms of sex discrimination.

						<h2>History of the ERA</h2>
						<p> The Equal Rights Amendment was first draft by Alice Paul in 1923, following the adoption of the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote in 1920. The ERA was introduced in every Congress between 1923 and 1972.  In 1972 the ERA was passed and sent to the states for ratification. The original seven-year deadline for ratification was extended to ten years, but by the end the ten years 35 states ratified, just three states short of the 38 needed for the amendment to become effective
                        </p>
                        <p> Because the right to sex equality is not enshrined in the United States Constitution, women and girls do not enjoy full Constitutional protection from discrimination on account of sex.  While many sex discriminatory laws have been repealed over the past century, and a number of laws have been passed to protect women and girls from sex discrimination, this legislation is not comprehensive and not necessarily permanent.  Sex inequality continues to pervade the lives of women and girls.
                        </p>
                        <p> Sex equality is a fundamental human right which should be in the Constitution, as it is in many other countries around the world.  While the Fourteenth Amendment has been interpreted to protect women from sex discrimination, the US Supreme Court has determined that unlike racial and religious discrimination, which is subject to a “strict standard” of review, sex discrimination is subject to a lesser “intermediate standard” of review.  Moreover, the Fourteenth Amendment has been interpreted to exclude discriminatory results unless discriminatory intent can be established.
                        </p>
                        <p> The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) will provide fundamental legal protection and will promote greater public understanding of discrimination against women and the right to sex equality.
